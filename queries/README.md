ActiveRecord Queries
Let's exercise your querying chops!

Part I

A Team and Player models have already been created for you, as well as the necessary code to create the tables and populate them with the following data:

team1 = Team.create name: "Warriors"
team1.players.create(name: "Klay", number: 11, position: "SG")
team1.players.create(name: "Steph", number: 30, position: "PG")
team1.players.create(name: "Iggy", number: 9, position: "SF")

team2 = Team.create name: "Cavs"
team2.players.create(name: "LeBron", number: 23, position: "SF")
team2.players.create(name: "Kyrie", number: 2, position: "PG")
team2.players.create(name: "Matthew", number: 8, position: "PG")
team2.players.create(name: "Timofey", number: 20, position: "C")

team3 = Team.create name: "Wolves"
team3.players.create(name: "Ricky", number: 9, position: "PG")
team3.players.create(name: "Andrew", number: 22, position: "SF")
team3.players.create(name: "Zach", number: 8, position: "SG")
You should be able to get all of this by running ruby populate.rb

Part II

Open the queries.rb file and write the following queries:

Get all the players for the first team
Get the team with the name "Cavs"
Get all players with the "PG" position for the team "Cavs"
Get the first 2 teams
Get all players of the "PG" position in reverse order by the time they were created (Newest to oldest)
Get the second and third teams
Get the players with ids 3 and 4, using the SQL IN clause
Count all the players with the "SF" position
At any point you should be able to run the file with ruby queries.rb.
